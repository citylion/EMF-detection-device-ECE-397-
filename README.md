# EMF-detection-device-ECE-397-
INTRODUCTION:
Hello, Our Senior Design Our project aims to build a device to detect EMF signals. This can detect signals from 100Mhz to 5Ghz. This is the spectrum of low ionizing radiation emitted by typical cell towers, phones, and Wi-fi. While these signals are considered non-ionizing and generally safe at low levels, there are debates about the potential long-term health effects of prolonged exposure. This device can help us conduct further data and raise concerns about EMF exposure in highly affected areas. 

REASONING: 
Due to the growing use of RF communications to transfer data for mobile calls, SMS, and Wi-Fi signals for internet access, there is some concern among the academic community that non-ionizing RF radiation may increase the risk of disease. Prolonged exposure to high power non-ionizing RF radiation. In other cases, in some industrial settings RF signals may interfere with certain equipment. Unfortunately, many RF measurement devices only measure the intensity of the total EMF radiation, and do not give a spectrum breakdown. Additionally, many devices are sold by foreign brands without clear reliability regarding the standards of design and manufacturing. 

OBJECTIVE: 
The goal is to design and develop an EMF detector that measures and displays EMF levels depending on the location of the user, providing individuals concerned with EMFâ€™s valuable data. The system will detect low and high-frequency electromagnetic radiation and provide real time data and alerts to the user regarding the EMF waves. The system will include geolocation tracking and data logging in order to map out to the user areas of high EMF waves that the user can further choose to avoid in the future.
